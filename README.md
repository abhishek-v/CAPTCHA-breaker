# CAPTCHA-breaker
Convolutional neural network for breaking SimpleCaptcha, a Java library for generating CAPTCHAS.

SimpleCaptcha is the CAPTCHA library used by SASTRA University for their Parent-Web interface. 

The dataset consists of 5000 images which is more than sufficient to get a good accuracy. However, I do have a 10k images dataset which you can request.

The python code is for a CNN based on Keras.
